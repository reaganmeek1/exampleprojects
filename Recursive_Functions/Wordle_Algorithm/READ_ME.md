  In Spring 2022, Wordle was all the rage. Everyone with a phone tried to solve the 5 word puzzle of the day, and caputred the attention and mind's of millions of people.

  I don't like to lose, so I created an algorithm that would help me solve the wordle of the day. This has become a project I am most proud of, and was a time where I saw my Computer Science knowledge and skills have real-world applications. From this project, I taught my whole family about recursion and letter combinations, and now they do the same to figure out there wordles!

  It has a dictionary of "all" English language, and based on the input the user give's it, it returns words of the matching combination, all 5 letters. The "dict-eng.txt" file has many, many English words, and not all of them are 5 letters, of course, so recursivity and combinatorics were essential for this project. The way it works is if you have no letters, or it is your first play, you would put "-----". Let's say you know there is an I in the 2nd position, and an L in the 4th position, you would input "-I-L-", and it would return words that match that specific input. The file "wordle.cpp" is where most of the implementation exists, and  and "wordle-driver" is where the execution takes place. It was a fun take on recursive functions, and this especially shows as you must recurse through every word in the dictionary and uses combinatorics to wittle down the possible options it returns to the user.
