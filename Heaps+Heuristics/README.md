In this project, I created an implementation of the game "Rush Hour", where you need to have cars in a parking lot arranged randomly, and need to move parked cars cars in a minimum amount of moves to free the target car, which needs to leave through the exit. Here is an online version of the game: https://www.transum.org/Maths/Investigation/CarPark/Default.asp?Level=1

I used hueristic and Min/Max Heap concepts and used recursive "heapify" functions to implement this fun, yet challenging game.
